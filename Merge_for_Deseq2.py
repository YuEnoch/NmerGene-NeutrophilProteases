#Merge_for_Deseq2.py 
#Based off code from Dr. Kart Tomberg -> https://github.com/tombergk/NNK_VWF73/

#Purpose: takes in all Peptide Counts for each treatment and merges all into one Table (ready to be analyzed by Deseq2), with peptides of low counts filtered out
#Changes across Experiments: please alter on parameters.txt
# 1. Location of Mutagenesis
# 2. Mutagenesis for 5 Amino Acids
# 3. Number of Treatments

#Manual Changes: please alter within this Python Script
# 1. Filters any peptide where total counts across all treatments are below 6 (or any defined Threshold)
